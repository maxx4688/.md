# This comes with a hashtag before the sentence

## Double hashtag results this

The registration - Just a simple sentence without any addition

1. The first line.
2. The second line.
3. The third line.
4. Just like this you can add multiple lines of texts like a bulletlist

# Let's see an example  
**Note-1** : The `Text` and `text1` with default text can be also used respectively.
- This is just a normal sentence started with a hyphon to mark as bulletlist **This with two stars start & end**(http status code: 400):

## Title - a syntax presentation docs.

- Methods: `this.method`
- Request endPoint: `this.endPoint`
- Res.body:

```json
{
  "Method added": ["add1", "add2", "add3", "add4"]
}
```
# Let's try  another example

- with a hyfen this could be a bulletlist
- And now you can easily define: `a text`

- Just using the backquote three times results simple format with white colour
```
{
  "call": ["man", "horse", "Cat"]
}
```
- Whereas adding `any code format` after the backquote results coloured snippet of that same programming language.
```json
{
  "call": ["man", "horse", "Cat"]
}
```
